# hugging-face-learning
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that implements various libraries by Hugging Face. The goal of this project is to learn Hugging Face and make an LLM from scratch, using nothing pre-trained, as well as pre-trained models.

The Jupyter notebooks are executed on the Google Colab Platform with TPU v2 machines (unless stated otherwise).

The following are covered in these files:
